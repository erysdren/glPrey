# glPrey

![a 3d level viewed in wireframe](.github/demo4_bsp_gl.png)

An OpenGL viewer for Prey (1995) BSP files written in C with SDL2.

It requires two files from the Prey 1995 alpha: `DEMO4.BSP` and `MACT.WAD`. The alpha can be downloaded here: [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/prey-1195/)

## Credits

- [Paril](https://github.com/Paril): Helped me figure out texture mapping.

## Building

In a UNIX-like environment:

```
cd glPrey/
make
```

## Notes

- Only tested on Linux so far. Additional compatibility for Windows may be needed to build.
- Texture mapping is not *quite* right, but it's close enough to look good.
- Lightmaps are still a mystery.
- If you happen to find any other BSPs or WADs from the Prey engine, you can specify them on the commandline with `--bsp` and `--wad`.

## Controls

- WASD: Move
- Shift: Speed
- Mouse: Look
- Arrow Keys: Look
